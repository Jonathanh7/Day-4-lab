//Exercise #1
//Write a while loop that starts counting from 5.
//Count up to (including) 50 and count only every fifth number
//Don' forget to log it


//Exercise #2
//Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument.
//This function should return the first duplicate number in the array:
// For example: [2,7,5,9,8,7] should return 7;



//Exercise #3
//Write a function that loops over the following array of TKH students
// and prints out their name and what class they are currently in.
// example => Ajitha is in class 2022-01-RTT 
const students = [
  "Ajitha",
  "Amari",
  "Anne",
  "Aylin",
  "Bosen",
  "Charlton",
  "Demmy",
  "Godbless",
  "Hee",
  "Janet",
  "Junior",
  "Lance",
  "Nyasho",
  "Poojitha",
  "Rebbecca",
  "Saif",
  "Stephanus",
  "Vedha"
];





//Exercise #4
//http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm
//
//Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle:
//First: Create a function called calcCircumference
// - Pass the radius to the function
// - Calculate the circumference based on the radius
// - and output " The circumference is SOMETHING"
// Second: Create a function called calcArea:
// - Pass the radius to the function
// - Calculate the area based on the radius and output "The area is SOMETHING"



//Exercise #5
//Create a function called mixUp
//It should take in two stings, and return the concatenation of the two strings(separated by a space)
//slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. 
//For example:
//mixUp('mix', 'pod'): 'pox mid'
//mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
//write answer below 




//Exercise #6
//Write a function that takes 3 parameters and returns one number, which is
//the product of the first two numbers raised to the power of the third
//passing this function 1,2,3 should give you back the answer to (1 * 2)^3
